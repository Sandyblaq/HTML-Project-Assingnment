        <h1>Spaghetti</h1>
        <p>
          Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical
          pasta.[1] It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like
          other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes
          enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically
          made from durum wheat semolina.[2] Usually the pasta is white because
          refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni
          is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin
          spaghetti.

        <h2>How To Prepare Spaghatti</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stir fry the Onions, scallions and bay leaves in the Oil for about a
            minute or 2 then season with curry powder, soup base Thyme and salt
            to taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the ground beef and break into somewhat big chunks (don't break
            them too much) and allow it to cook in its own juice until it's
            almost done (about 90 percent done)
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the sauce and cook for a while in the meat juice for about 2 to
            3 minutes then add some water to thin it out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Break the spaghetti into 2 to 3 parts (if this is a taboo for you
            you can just cook it 'as is') and add it into a hot boiling Water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add salt to taste and cook for about 8 minutes then take it off the
            heat and drain the Water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the boiled pasta to the sauce together with the mixed
            vegetables, sliced Tomatoes, and the rest of the scallions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow it to come to a simmer for about 3 more minutes and take it
            off the heat.
          </li>
          <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
